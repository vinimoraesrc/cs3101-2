For this expression to make sense and return no exceptions,
the variable x would have to have 'Unit' type and y would
need to have a numeric type. For instance:

> var y = 5
y: Int = 5
> var x = {}
x: Unit = ()
> x = y = 1
x: Unit = ()

If we println(x), we can see that x is still (), while y now has a value
of 1.
