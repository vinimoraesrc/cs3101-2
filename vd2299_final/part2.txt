The progam prints the following:
function4
function2
function2
function1
function3
function3
scala is scala

Sequence of function calls and return values:

1) function4 is called and then the line println("function4") is executed.

2) the line val z = fun("scala") is executed. Since the parameter fun was function2,
it is evaluated, which causes function2 to execute its println("function2") line and return
the function, which is assigned to z.

3) the line val y = fun("is") is executed, which causes function2 to be evaluated again,
causing it to print one more time and return the function, which is assigned to the val y.

4) the line z(y(x)) is executed. Scala first evaluated 'x'. Since the parameter for x was
the function1, it is called, which causes the program to print "function1". function1 then returns
"scala".

5) "scala" is passed as an argument to the function previously assigned to val y. This function then prints "function3" and returns "is scala".

6) the function assigned to val z receives "is scala" as a parameter and then executes, first
printing "function3" again and then returning "scala is scala".

7) finally, the result of the call to function4(function2, function1) is printed, so the terminal
displays "scala is scala".
